1.C++函数传参

	class People

			void Print()
			{

			};
	
	};
	
	//值传递,传递变量的副本
	void Change1(People people) 
	{
		//变量的成员变量改变,实参不会改变
		/*people.name = "Andrew1";
		people.age = 18;
		people.sex = "man";*/
	
		//变量本身改变,实参不会改变
		people = People("Andrew1", 18, "man");
		
	}
	
	//引用传递,传递变量的地址
	void Change2(People& people)
	{
		//变量的成员变量改变,实参也会改变
		/*people.name = "Andrew2";
		people.age = 18;
		people.sex = "man";*/
		
		//变量本身改变,实参也会改变
		people = People("Andrew2", 18, "man");
	}
	
	//指针传递,传递变量的地址的指针
	void Change3(People* people)
	{

		//或者下面的写法
		/*(*people).name = "Andrew3";
		(*people).age = 18;
		(*people).sex = "man";*/
	
		//指针变量创建,需要new
		//变量本身改变,实参不会改变
		//people = new People("Andrew3", 18, "man");
	}
	
	//引用传递,传递指针的引用
	void Change4(People*& people) 
	{
		//变量的成员变量改变,实参也会改变
		/*people->name = "Andrew4";
		people->age = 18;
		people->sex = "man";*/
	
		//变量本身改变,实参也会改变
		people = new People("Andrew4", 18, "man");
	}
	
	//指针传递,传递指针的指针
	void Change5(People** people)
	{
		//变量的成员变量改变,实参也会改变
		/*(*people)->name = "Andrew5";
		(*people)->age = 18;

		*people = new People("Andrew5", 18, "man");
	}
	
	
	int main()
	{
	
		/*
			Change2、Change4不能被共用
			Change2只能传入People people对象
			Change4只能传入People* people2对象
	
			Change3能被共用
			People people对象传&people
			People* people2对象传people2
		*/
	
		std::cout << "People people = People(\"Charlse\", 19, \"woman\")" << std::endl;
		People people = People("Charlse", 19, "woman");
		
		Change1(people);
		people.Print();
		Change2(people);
		people.Print();
		Change3(&people);
		people.Print();
		
		std::cout << "People* people2 = new People(\"Charlse\", 19, \"woman\")" << std::endl;
		People* people2 = new People("Charlse", 19, "woman");
		Change3(people2);
		people2->Print();
		Change4(people2);
		people2->Print();
		Change5(&people2);
		people2->Print();
	
	}


输出

	People people = People("Charlse", 19, "woman")
	name:Charlse,age:19,sex:woman
	name:Andrew2,age:18,sex:man
	name:Andrew3,age:18,sex:man
	People* people2 = new People("Charlse", 19, "woman")
	name:Andrew3,age:18,sex:man
	name:Andrew4,age:18,sex:man
	name:Andrew5,age:18,sex:man
